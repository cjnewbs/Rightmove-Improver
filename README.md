#Rightmove Improver
###About
I wrote this extension when I was using Rightmove to search for a new place to live. Internet speed is an important factor for me and I was frustrated that you could not see this on the main property view page. This extension places the maximum internet speed above the link in the internet speed box on property view pages.

###Installation
Download the files and save them in their own directory then navigate to chrome://extensions/ in your Chrome browser. Tick developer mode in the top right-hand corner and 3 new buttons should appear. Click Load unpacked extension and select the location of the directory you saved the files to. The extension is now installed.
